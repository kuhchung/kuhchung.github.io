# Sword and Shield

TODO: pictures

## Overview
This weapon is so mobile and fluid. I don't have much to say about it, but will spit out the bread and butter.

## Non-Disruption
You never want to perform the shield bash mid combo. This attack does no damage and bashes teammates away.

If you want to perform a shield bash, then it should be deliberate. For example, you can get a few good shield bashes into Uragaan's chin during his farts, and no other opening is available, and you won't be bashing teammates.

## Damage Optimization
Your bread and butter combo is:
X+A (optional to get into position), X X X, neutral stick A A.
> Make sure your joystick is neutral for A, or you'll get the shield bash.  
> The leap attack (X+A) even gives you temporary flinch-proof!

If your position is very sensitive, I prefer to simply stand still and wait for the second A attack animation to end. Then repeat X X X A A again.

If you can roll into the monster and maintain position, I cancel the second A into a roll and continue X X X A A.

If you can maintain position in the above, you can probably perform the + roundslash attack as your finisher, but I never do this.
