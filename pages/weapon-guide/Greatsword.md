## High Skill Ceiling
This is the hardest weapon in the game! It requires very, very deep knowledge of monster movements, where to stand, and proper timing.

## Don't combo!
You should not be performing combos with this weapon, unless it involves hitting multiple level 3 charges. 

## Non-Disruption
This is sort of covered by the "Don't combo!" topic, but avoid/never upswing. This launches teammates.

## Hit and Run
Greatsword is a hit and run weapon. Barring special circumstances (Jhen Mohran), every Greatsword set runs Critical Draw. You will perform a draw attack on the monster, charged or not, sheathe, and then go for your next opening.

The majority of your openings are going to come during monster turns. Aim for where the monster is going to be, not where the monster currently is, and charge up!

## Know your armor, know your matchups
Greatsword has the most tooling in armor building, in my opinion. Your mandatory skills are Sharpness +1 and Critical Draw. Then, the following skills are still available to you, and you should vary based on which monster you are facing.

Focus  
Tremor-Proof  
Earplugs  
High Grade Earplugs  
Trapmaster
