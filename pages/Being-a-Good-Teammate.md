# Being a Good Teammate

The difference between a good and bad teammate is night and day. Here’s how you can be considerate and make the hunting experience more enjoyable for everyone, as well as completing a hunt faster!


## DO


* Bring the correct supplies
    * Yes, everyone will forget the corresponding drink once in a while. But just do your best! These things should almost always be in your hunting pouch:
        * Traps
        * Tranquilizers
        * Potions (Mega, Max, Ancient)
        * Flash bombs or sonic bombs or both
        * Dung bombs (I’m guilty of not bringing this enough)
        * Hot or Cool Drinks, where applicable
        * Whetstones or ammo combines
        * Large Barrel Bomb+s
        * Stamina recovery if you didn't eat for stamina (Steak, Dash Juice, Energy Drink)
    * Other nice things include:
        * Buffs (pills and seeds)
        * Lifepowder
        * Paintballs
        * Trap combine materials
* Go with the flow
    * If someone sets a trap and everyone is waiting behind it, just go wait with them. Even if you think it’s not the correct play, it’ll go much faster if you work together as a team.
    * If someone brings a Morpheus Knife or an Azure Crest to Alatreon, expect to be bombing. A LOT. Bring your bomb combine materials!
* If you wish something would be done, then _be_ the one to do it!
    * Diablos is sonic bombed, and you hope someone is going to flash it out of the air. But you don’t see anyone moving into position. Then Goa and Bie the change you want to see in the hunt!
* Give your teammate a little kick to get them out of a long animation… but don’t troll!
    * People are gathering ballista ammo and Jhen is about to launch rocks. Give your teammates a little kick so they’re not stuck gathering so they can run away.
    * Kick canceling sharpens or carves is a little trickier, so if you’re uncertain, just leave them alone :)
* Choose your weapon based on your team composition
    * Unless you’re doing some sort of specialized strategy (like some sort of specific speedrun attempt), general hunting parties do not want more than 1 hammer or a duplicated status weapon.


## DON’T



* GS Upswing
    * Unless you seriously know what you are doing, just don’t ever do this. It even launches teammates behind you.
* Lance charge
    * Same as the GS upswing. By the way, on land, this isn't even faster than running.
* If teammates are whaling on a disabled monster, roll out of your charged superpound and go for a triple. Don't superpound your teammates! 
* Tripping your teammates with your status weapon during your disable
    * You got a paralyze. Great! Now let your team work and don't trip them. Prepare to place a trap, or flash bomb, or find an unoccupied area to hit it, or just chill. We don't need your green sharpness Shadowbinder damage while you trip your lancers or SnS hitters.
* Fire pellet ammo in a group
    * Or crag
* Afk mining during a hunt
    * For gods sake don't come on a hunt to volcano in leather+ and go on a solo harvest tour. This is the worst offense.
